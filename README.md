# mental-health
 Building end to end project[building models and webapp] to predict the mental health by the songs they listened to. Although we cannot reliably predict mental health rankings from music alone,It just a try ,a part of learnings.</br>

RUN LOCALLY?.</br>

For this project python version -`3.10`
1. clone this repo
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. navigate to root folder (here webb\)
4. run using command `python manage.py runserver`

The output comes between range of `0 - 10` ,`0 -> low`, `10 -> extreme`

Navigate through `notebook` folder for ml insights</br>
Cheersâœ¨
